4	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
5	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
6	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
7	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
8	He was very much admired indeed.	4
9	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	1
10	But the Tree shook its head.	1
11	你一脸幸福哪。	0
12	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	3
13	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
14	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	1
15	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
16	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
17	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	0
18	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	0
19	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	3
20	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
21	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
22	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
23	黑人们抓过他手里的珍珠，又把他推向海中。	3
24	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.'	2
25	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	4
26	不久，春天来了，乡间到处开满小小花朵，小鸟儿到处飞舞。	0
27	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	3
28	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	1
29	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
30	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
31	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
32	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说，	2
33	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
34	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	1
35	Upon my word,' said the Miller with anger, 'you are very lazy.	2
36	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
37	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	3
38	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	0
39	I am very glad I have travelled.	0

41	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	0
42	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	3
43	快快滚到一边。	2
44	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
45	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	1
46	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
