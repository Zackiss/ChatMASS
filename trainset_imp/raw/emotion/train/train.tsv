1	Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring- time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. 	0
2	他顿时感到一阵巨大的恐惧，他跟织工说：“你在织什么样的长袍？”	3
3	那天下午孩子们跑进来时，发现巨人躺在那棵树下死了，身上盖满了白色的鲜花。	1
4	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
5	And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.	1
6	But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.	1
7	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
8	“你是谁？”巨人问道，一种莫名的恐惧传遍他全身，他在小男孩儿面前跪下了。	3
9	The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.	3
10	“哎呀！我的儿，”她哭叫道，“我走之前你不吻我吗？	1
11	一尊用青铜铸就的那喀索斯国雕像笑容满面，将一面打磨得亮提提的镜子举过头顶。	0
12	The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.	0
13	It is not comfortable here, he remarked, "but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
14	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
15	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
16	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."	3
17	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
18	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	4
19	Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.	1
20	可是守城的士兵把手里的矛枪往城门口一横,对他粗鲁地说：“你到城里有什么事？”	2
21	It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.	0
22	'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. 	2
23	He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.	1
24	Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.	0
25	“我有许多美丽的花儿，”他说，“可是孩子们才是所有花中最美丽的花朵啊。”	0
26	星孩跟他说：“我口袋里只有一块黄金，可我要是不把它带给我的主人，那他就会打我，把我当奴隶养。”	3
27	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
28	乞丐在城市里行乞，和狗一样捡食吃。	1
29	I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.	0
30	“喟啾！喟啾！喟啾！”绿红雀叽叽咕咕地唠叨着，“这大地老人冻死了，他们给她穿戴了一身白衣服准备入殓下葬了。	1
31	星孩对他说：“我没有带来。”	1
32	到了第三天，魔术师又来找他，说：“今天你要是给我把那块红金子帯来，我就给你自由，但要是你带不来，看我不把你杀了。”	3
33	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
34	“我们的老板！”织工恶狠狠地大声说。	2
35	My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.	4
36	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
37	He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.	0
38	Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. 	0
39	Well, really, exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, why not? It is a most joyful occasion.	0
40	It's quite clear that they love each other, said the little Page, "as clear as crystal!" and the King doubled his salary a second time.	0
41	He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.	4
42	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
43	You are a very irritating person," said the Rocket, "and very illbred.	2
44	后来，潜水者最后一次从水中上来,他带上来的那颗珍珠比所有的霍尔木兹回的珍珠还漂亮，它像满月那样有模有样,比晨星还耀眼。	0
45	他们只好到大路上玩耍，可是路上灰尘太多，而且到处都是粗糙的石头，他们一点也不喜欢在路上玩。	1
46	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.	3
47	他到处寻找，却总找不到魔术师说的那块白金，找啊找啊，从早上找到中午，从中午找到夕阳西下。	1
48	有一次他们陷进了深雪坑,挣脱出来就像正在磨面的磨工那样子白了；有一次他们滑进了池水结冰的光滑冰面上，他们的柴火摔散了捆，他们只好把柴火捡起来，重捆在一起；又有一次他们以为迷了路，心下害怕得要命，因为他们知道雪对任何睡在它们怀里的人都毫不留情。	3
49	“呜呜呜！”狼嗥叫着，两条后腿夹着尾巴慢吞吞地在灌木丛里穿行，“这真是冻死人的鬼天气。	2
50	It was certainly a magnificent display.	0
51	然而春天一直没有来，夏季也一直不来。	1
52	“不死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
53	年轻的国王眼里充满泪水，他在人们的窃窃私语中走过，那小侍从心下害怕,离开了他。	3
54	What a remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.	0
55	巨人最爱那小男孩儿，因为小男孩儿亲吻过他。	4
56	“别这样，上帝连麻雀都关心，给它们吃的呢。”他回答说。	4
57	The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. 	0
58	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
59	“你们在这里干什么？”他喊叫道,声音很霸道，孩子们赶紧跑散了。	2
60	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
61	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，不过这也不出我所料。	2
62	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
63	他不准许任何人虐待鸟儿和野兽，而是教人懂得爱、亲情和仁慈；他向穷人发放面包，向衣不蔽体的人发放衣服，在他的国土上，到处一片祥和富足的景象。	4
64	星孩十分心痛兔子，就把它放了，并对它说：“我自己虽然是一个奴隶，我却要让你获得自由。”	4
65	跟我走吧,我的儿子，我需要你的爰哪。	4
66	但是那麻风病人看他来了,跑上去迎住他，跪下来大声说：“给我一点儿钱花吧，要不我就饿死了。”	1
67	玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺朝那刺儿靠近再靠近。	3
68	野猪在山谷里拱吃玉米的根，狐狸咬断山间的葡萄藤。	3
69	我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。	1
70	但是，瞧！他走过城门时，卫兵们点头哈腰向他行礼，说：“我们的君主多么美啊！”一群市民追随在他身后，大声嚷叫说：“这全世界都没有这么美的人啊！”	0
71	Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.	0
72	那是第二天就要举行加冕典礼的那天夜晚，年轻的国王独自坐在他的美丽的宫室里。	0
73	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水。	1
74	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney- pots down.	2
75	The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.	1
76	微弱的日光从格子窗户映照进来，他借光看见一个个瘦削的织工们在织机前埋头忙活。	1
77	人们在十二点钟去市场时，发现巨人在他们见过的最美丽的花园里和孩子们玩耍。	0
78	但是谁都不敢看他的脸，只因他的脸像天使的圣容。	4
79	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
80	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.	2
81	The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. 	2
82	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
83	他立即进了门，把那孩子塞进她的怀里；她亲过孩子，把他放在他们家最小的孩子躺着的小床上。	4
84	There is a way, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
85	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
86	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：“母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
87	“你们俩不能躺在这里。”巡警厉声喝道，两个小男孩儿只好走进了雨中。	2
88	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
89	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
90	他走得很近时，他的脸色因为生气变得通红，他说：“是谁竟敢伤害你？”	2
91	三年中他就这样在世界上寻找，这世界既没人爱他，也没人怜悯他或对他慈悲,可是这个世界正是他春风得意时为自己创造的啊。	1
92	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：“我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
93	热病在人群中畅行无阻，见人就摸，被她摸过的人全都死掉了。	3
94	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
95	Nay! answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."	4
96	他的同伴们追随他，因为他漂亮，腿脚快，能跳舞，会吹奏，写曲子。	0
97	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
98	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
99	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
100	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
101	我要去'死神殿'了。	3
102	船长见状哈哈大笑，伸岀手把那颗珍珠拿起来，端详过后，他把珍珠按在额头,鞠了一躬。	0
103	那麻风病人看见他来了，站在大路中间，大声嚷叫起来，说：“快把那块红金子给我吧，要不我就死定了。	3
104	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
105	How happy we are here! they cried to each other.	0
106	有谁关心过咱们？	1
107	麻风病人生活在盐泽地里，居住在芦苇茅草屋里，谁都不理他们。	1
108	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
109	于是夜莺朝那刺儿靠得越来越狠，那刺儿终于扎住了她的心，一阵剧烈的疼痛传遍她的全身。	3
110	印度一些设防的城市里流行饥荒，撤马尔罕的水塘耗干了。	1
111	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
112	The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.	0
113	天气冷得岀奇，连动物和鸟儿都不知道怎样对付下去了。	3
114	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
115	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
116	母亲啊，我过去给了你恨。	1
117	And I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.	3
118	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'	3
119	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
120	一个人从人群里走岀来，恶狠狠地跟他说：老爷，难道你不明白穷人的生活仰仗富人的奢侈吗？	2
121	许多年过去了,巨人年纪很大很大了,身体衰老得不行。	1
122	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
123	母亲，我当初拒绝了你。	1
124	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
125	“国王的花园算不上世界,你这傻爆筒，”一个大焰火筒说，“世界是一个大得不能再大的地方，你花上三天时间把它看遍就不错了。	2
126	他早先去拜访他的朋友、康沃尔的吃人魔去了，和吃人魔一呆就是七年。	3
127	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
128	When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.	4
129	The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.	0
130	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
131	他把他那棕色的髯发从额头往后梳理一下,拿起古琵琶，手指在弦上随意弹动。	0
132	高兴起来吧。	0
133	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
134	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
135	他们一脸饥饿相，瘦弱的手哆嗦个不停。	1
136	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
137	The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. 	0
138	他穿着漂亮的王服，站立在他们面前，风琴弹岀了乐曲，号手吹响了他们的号角，童子唱起了圣诗。	0
139	他于是走到水井旁，往下看去，瞧呀!他的脸果真像癞蛤蟆的脸，他的身上像蛭蛇一样长满了鳞片。	3
140	And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."	0
141	But nobody saw him.	1
142	所以你别哭了。	4
143	我这件皇袍是悲伤的织机织的，是痛苦的苍白的手织的。	1
144	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us, and they drave him out of the garden.	2
145	年轻的国王想开口说话，可是他的舌头好像粘在他的上顎上,嘴唇怎么也张不开。	3
146	 For if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.	1
147	最后他对她开了口，话语又生硬又刻薄。	2
148	True love suffers, and is silent.	1
149	树的枝杈全是金色，银闪闪的果子挂在枝头，树下站着他爱恋的那个小男孩儿。	4
150	太阳落山时他只好朝家的方向走去，哭得伤心极了，因为他知道什么命运在等着他。	1
151	Romance is a thing of the past.	1
152	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
153	Yet did his beauty work him evil, for he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
154	Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.	0
155	Poor people, to lose their only son!	1
156	他又抽泣起来，说：母亲，我的痛苦使我不堪忍受啊。	1
157	“办法倒是有的，”玫瑰树回答说,“可是那办法太可怕，我都不敢告诉你。”	3
158	When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.	0
159	我生养了六个美丽的女儿，我很担心狗鱼碰见她们。	3
160	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
161	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
162	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
163	她捶打着她那不育的胸脯,大声哭叫起来。	2
164	奴隶们赤身裸体，只缠着一块破腰布,每个人都用铁链与相邻的人拴在一起。	3
165	就在他转身哭着离去时，一个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人走了过来，询问那些士兵一心想进城门的人是谁。	1
166	疟疾在广大的人群中畅行无阻，三分之一的人立即倒地身亡。	1
167	“是强盗把你从我怀里夺走，扔下你死掉不管的，”她唠叨说，“但是我一看见你就认出来了，我也认出这两件东西了，就是这金丝斗篷和琥珀项链。	1
168	瞧这冷风一个劲儿往屋里刮，我都冻死了。	3
169	We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.	0
170	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
171	And the Linnet answered, Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
172	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'	4
173	It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.	0
174	我不是你的儿子，用不着听你说三道四。	2
175	And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.	4
176	Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."	0
177	织工气愤地看着他，说：你看我干什么？	2
178	What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.	2
179	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
180	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
181	For the next three days everybody went about saying, "White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.	0
182	认识自己的朋友可是非常危险的事情。	3
183	但是他的伙伴回答他说：“不，把一个小娃娃扔在雪地里冻死在这儿，这是作孽啊；尽管我像你一样穷苦，拉家带口,连锅都揭不开了，可是我却要把他带回家,我老婆会照管他的。”	4
184	接着冰雹停止了在头顶砰砰乱跳，北风不再呼呼吼叫,一股扑鼻的香气从开着的窗扉飘到了他跟前。	0
185	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
186	“我们当时过得多么幸福。”他们彼此诉说道。	1
187	It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.	0
188	樵夫这时在附近一个木料场里砍木头，看见了星孩的所作所为，就跑过来训斥他说：“你真是铁石心肠，一点不知可怜人，这个可怜的女人究竟干了什么坏事惹了你，你这样对待他？”	2
189	你是老几，竟敢给上帝的世界带来痛苦？	2
190	疆鼠回答说：“你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
191	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
192	据说那个墓穴里还躺着一个人，死者是一个异常英俊美丽的青年，他的双手用绳子反绑着，胸部被捅了很多刀，衣服都被血染红了。	3
193	To–day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.	2
194	他站在了耶稣像前，他的右手和左手都是精美的金制器皿、盛着葡萄酒的圣餐杯和盛着圣油的玻璃杯。	0
195	那确实是一幕让人惊喜的景色。	0
196	我的山谷与你有什么关系，你非赖着不走？快走吧，别再到这里来。	2
197	整整一天他都在呼唤她，太阳西下时他就躺在树叶床上睡觉，鸟儿和野兽都从他身边逃走，因为他们都想起来他心毒手狠，除了癞蛤蟆守在他身边，还有蛭蛇缓缓爬了过去，他孤零零地一个人呆着。	1
198	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
199	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
200	枯干的刺儿开了花，开出的红玫瑰比红宝石还艳红。	0
201	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
202	“不，”兔子回答说，“只不过像你又寸待我那样，我同样地对待你罢了。”兔子说完一转眼跑走了，星孩就朝城市走去。	4
203	王后对他说：“这是你曾救助过的你的亲生父亲。”	4
204	他气得满脸通红，对他们说：“我就是国王。”他把他们的矛戟挡到一边，闯了进去。	2
205	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
206	他觉得他在一片昏暗的林子里闲荡,上挂满了奇怪的果子和美丽的毒花儿。	3
207	“在战争中，”织工回答说，“强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
208	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, "I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
209	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?	3
210	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
211	And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, 'Why art thou watching me?	2
212	巨人悄悄地站在他身后，轻轻地把他拿在手里，放在了树上。	4
213	他真心为他过去的行为感到后悔。	1
214	There is neither society here, nor solitude.	1
215	街上突然传来一阵闹哄哄的喧嚣，那些宫廷大员来势汹汹闯了进来，他们手中的剑已出鞘，盾牌闪着金属的光泽，头上的冠羽摇来晃去。	3
216	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
217	但是她并没有消气，反而取笑他，越说气越大，最后哭泣道：“我们的孩子都没有面包吃，我们还养得起别人的孩子吗？	2
218	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
219	年轻的国王哭了，说：“这些人是谁，他们在寻找什么？”	1
220	那女人就回答他：“我是你的母亲呀。”	4
221	He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.	1
222	“一位远比我伟大的人为你加冕了啊！”他高声赞叹着，在年轻的国王面前跪了下来。	0
223	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
224	'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
225	Get thee gone.	2
226	“不，”死亡说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就不走。	3
227	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
228	人们肃然起敬，纷纷跪了下来，宫廷大员们赶快把剑收进鞘里，俯首称臣，主教的脸顿时变得惨白，双手抖动不止。	3
229	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
230	还不如冻死在树林里好呢，要么让什么野兽撞上咱们，吃了也行啊。	3
231	小松鼠回答说：“你已经把我妈妈杀害了。	2
232	这是一幕可爱的景色，只有花园的一隅还是冬天。	0
233	They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.	0
234	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."	2
235	但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。	0
236	然而玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺把那刺顶得更紧些。	3
237	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
238	Whenever we appear we excite great attention.	0
239	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
240	TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED	3
241	但是孩子们一看见他，吓得胆战心惊，纷纷逃跑了,花园又变成了冬天。	3
242	巨人欣喜若狂地跑下楼梯，岀了房子冲进花园。	0
243	Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.	0
244	他穿着一身灰色服装，他吐出的气跟冰差不多。	1
245	Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky."	0
246	星孩回答他们说：“我不是什么国王的儿子，只是一个可怜的要饭女人的孩子。	1
247	星孩回答说：“我在寻找一块藏在这里的黄金，我要是找不到它，我的主人会打我，把我当奴隶使唤的。”	1
248	已经是冬天了，”燕子回答说，这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	3
249	“不！ ”孩子回答说，“这是爱的伤痕呀。”	4
250	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？”	2
251	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
252	那些跑掉的孩子，看出来巨人不再像过去那样坏，又都跑回来，春天也跟着孩子们来了。	0
253	雪往草地盖上了她那巨大的白色斗篷，霜把所有的树都涂上了银色。	0
254	I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
255	But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. 	3
256	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
257	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。”	3
258	Well, good-bye, I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you."	0
259	”这块土地是自由的，”年轻的国王说，“你不是任何人的奴隶。”	0
260	太阳西下时，他坐在地上哭起来，可就在哭泣时，他从陷阱里救上来的小兔子来到了他的跟前。小兔子跟他说：“你哭什么？	1
261	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说：“他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
262	不，你真的是我的小儿子啊，我当时把你生在树林里了，”她哭叫着，跪在地上，向星孩伸出她的双臂，	1
263	但是，他们转喜为悲，因为他们想起他们家境贫穷，其中一个对另一个说:“我们有什么好快乐的？瞧瞧这生活是偏向富人的，不是为我们这等人着想的！	1
264	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
265	What a pity!	1
266	他们把我赶岀了城门，谁都不管我的死活。	2
267	我们和那些辛辛苦苦为我们劳作的人有什么关系？一个人非得亲眼看见播种的人才可以吃面包吗？一个人非得和踩榨葡萄酒的人交谈过才可以喝葡萄酒吗？	2
268	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
269	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
270	老头儿从缠头布上取下一块花绸布，蒙在星孩的眼睛上，推操着往前面走。	3
271	过了一会儿，她转过身来，看着丈夫,眼里噙满了泪水。	1
272	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
273	“要是你真的是我的生身母亲，”他说，“那你还是离去的好，别在这儿让我丢脸，你瞧我原以为我是某颗星星的孩子,而不是一个叫花子的孩子，像你和我说的那样。	2
274	My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.	3
275	“这位穿戴得像一个乞丐的国王在哪里------就是给我们王国带来耻辱的男孩儿？我们一定要杀了他,他根本不配统治我们。”	2
276	“可我就喜欢争论。”火箭说。	2
277	The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.	0
278	这片树林从外面看去非常漂亮，好像到处都是欢唱的鸟儿，到处都是温馨的花朵，星孩满心高兴地走了进去。	0
279	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
280	百合花比精选的珍珠还白净啊，百合花的茎比银子还纏亮。	0
281	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
282	那棵可怜的树仍然盖满了霜和雪，北风呼呼地吹，在树梢上呜呜地叫。	1
283	星孩回答说：“我没有带来。”	1
284	“快爬上来呀，小男孩儿！” 树说着，尽可能低地垂下了他的树枝，但是小男孩儿太幼小，还是够不着。	1
285	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
286	I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.	1
287	魔术师扑上去，对他一顿狠打，并且用链子把他拴了起来，又投进了地牢里。	2
288	她用翅膀把山谷覆盖上，无一人活了下来。	1
289	因此，快让我们的君主戴上这顶皇冠，拿上这根权杖，以我们国王的公正和慈悲来统治我们吧。”	0
290	她要是给家里带不回一些钱，她父亲会打她的，她在哭泣。	3
291	Good-bye, cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.	0
292	他们终于脱险，因此高兴得不知怎么才好，哈哈大笑起来，大地在他们看来像一朵银花，月亮则像一朵金花。	0
293	一个样子凶恶的老头儿正好路过，大声吆喝说：“我出这个价买下他。”他把钱付清后，领着星孩进了城。	3
294	苦难在一大早就把我们弄醒，耻辱夜里和我们坐在一起。	1
295	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.	2
296	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.	4
297	他们中间的一个对另一个说：“我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
298	He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.	1
299	”他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
300	他们的小红爪子冻得不轻，可是他们觉得他们有责任对目前的局势采取浪漫的看法。	4
301	狮子伏击商队，吃掉骆驼。	3
302	凶恶的强盗下山抢走小孩,把他们卖给摩尔人。	3
303	In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.	0
304	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
305	“你说的是实话，”樵夫回答说，“可是我在树林里发现你时对你动了恻隐之心。”	4
306	只有那个小男孩儿没有跑掉，因为他的眼睛里满是泪水，没有看见巨人走了过来。	1
307	随后他开始感到全身上下一阵奇怪的刺痛。	3
308	Now I am going to explode, he cried.	3
309	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
310	But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.	1
311	Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. 	0
312	What a delightful voice you have! cried the Frog.	0
313	The world is certainly very beautiful, cried a little Squib.	0
314	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is my mother?	2
315	'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.	2
316	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
317	Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.	1
318	What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.	2
319	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
320	多么可怕的灾难！	3
321	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
322	魔术师于是朝他扑来，打了他一顿，在他面前放了一个空木盘，说：“吃吧。”然后又放了一个空杯子，说：“喝吧。”把他又扔进了地牢里。”	3
323	If they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.	0
324	年轻的国王大叫一声醒来，瞧！他在他自己的寝宫里，透过窗户他看见一轮蜜黄色明月悬在暗淡的天空。	3
325	但是他们不让进，还用他们的长矛刺他。	2
326	星孩一看她走了，心下欢喜，赶紧去找他可以一起玩耍的小伙伴去了。	0
327	It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.	0
328	今天你去给我把那块白金拿来,要是你拿不来，那我准会让你挨上一百鞭子。	2
329	 I shall never get over it.	1
330	你母亲没有住在这个城里。	1
331	可是星孩说：不，只怪我对我母亲冷酷无情，这种灾难就是对我的惩罚。	1
332	帆船船长立即拿起一张彩色弓，射中了其中一个人的喉咙。	3
333	The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.	4
334	请你给我爰吧。	4
335	我永远都对付不了这种事。	3
336	He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.	0
337	这样，那女人站了起来，向森林走去,哭得伤心极了。	1
338	他看见一幕美不胜收的景致。	0
339	I don't think much of that, said the Duck, "as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
340	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
341	他瘫倒在草地上哭了起来，跟自己说：“这肯定是我罪孽深重造成的苦果啊。	1
342	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道。	2
343	他过去从来没有如此急切地,或说如此狂喜地感受到诸多美丽的东西的魔力和真谛。	0
344	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
345	疟疾身后升起一股冷雾，一条条水蛇在她身旁乱跑。	3
346	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
347	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
348	“快使劲靠哪，小夜莺，”玫瑰树喊叫说，“要不然玫瑰花儿还没变红天就亮了。”	3
349	秋天给每一座花园带来了金色的果实,但是巨人的花园却得不到秋天的垂青。	1
350	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
351	花园里唯一感到高兴的人是雪和霜。	0
352	红雀儿回答说：“你图一时快活，把我的翅膀剪掉了。	2
353	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'	2
354	“用劲顶啊，小夜莺，”玫瑰树叫喊说，“要不然天亮时这朵玫瑰花儿还培育不成呢。”	3
355	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
356	I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.	2
357	As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.	0
358	他还很幼小,没法儿爬上树的枝杈，正围着那棵树转啊转啊，哭得伤心极了。	1
359	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
360	I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he went out.	0
361	The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.	0
362	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
363	我们种下玉米，我们的餐桌上却没有吃的。	1
364	他一回来就看见孩子们在花园里玩耍。	0
365	This is a delightful spot, he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." 	0
366	He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.	0
367	It certainly was a marvellous sight. 	0
368	他抽搐了一阵儿，接着就一动不动了。	3
369	有一次，一朵美丽的花儿从草地上探出头来，可是一看见那块告示牌，不禁为那些孩子感到十分难过，它把头又缩回地下去，呼呼睡起大觉来。	1
370	傍晚时分他坐了下来，伤心地哭泣；正哭着，那只小兔子又来到他跟前。	1
371	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'	3
372	我吃了很多苦才找到了你啊。”	1
373	他发沉的眼睑垂了下来，一种少有的消沉一下子支配了他。	1
374	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶哪。”	1
375	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说；他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
376	It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.	1
377	How happy we were there, they said to each other.	1
378	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
379	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'	2
380	埃及设防的城市里也流行饥荒，蝗虫是从大荒漠里出来的。	1
381	And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.	0
382	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
383	“啊呀，老公啊！”她嘟哝说，“难道我们自家的孩子还不够多，你非要捡一个弃儿往咱炉边挤吗？	2
384	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
385	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
386	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
387	这乐曲在他耳际萦绕，妙不可言，他原以为一定是国王的乐师演奏着曲子走过。	0
388	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
389	这确实令人心碎害怕！	3
390	我们为活着干活儿，他们给我们可怜的工资逼我们去死。	1
391	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
392	She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.	0
393	他一时忘了自己的忧愁，返身跑到那儿，看见一只小兔子掉进了猎人设下的陷阱。	1
394	实际上是你应该多想想我。	4
395	难道你是我们老板派来监视我们的探子吗？	2
396	那个老神父也经常找他去，尽心尽力教他热爱有生命的东西，并对他说：蝇子是你的兄弟。	4
397	“别说了，还是你首先对我大发善心的呀兔子说完，转眼就跑走了。	0
398	“我不明白为什么春天这么晚了还不来，”自私的巨人心下思忖，坐在窗前看着他那冰天雪地的花园，“但愿这气候变化变化才好。”	1
399	All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.	0
400	Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, "so we will live here all the year round."	1
401	And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.	0
402	我们整天为他们卖苦力，他们在金库里堆砌金子，我们的孩子们过早夭折了，我们热爰的那些人的脸变得冷酷而邪恶。	2
403	You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.	3
404	他老婆开了门，看见她丈夫平安回到身边，便把两条胳膊缠在丈夫脖子上亲吻丈夫，接着从他背上取下那捆柴火，扫掉他靴子上的雪，要他进屋子里来。	0
405	两只苍鹭在船周围飞来飞去。	3
406	可是孩子们说他们并不知道他住在哪里，过去从来也没有见过他；巨人觉得伤心极了。	1
407	但是爱情比生命更可贵，比起人的心，鸟的心又算得了什么？	4
408	她的歌儿越来越细弱，她觉得有什么东西堵住了她的喉咙。	3
409	你给我听着,你这人好无礼,你以为你是谁？	2
410	你就快快离开这里吧，别再让我看见你这张难看的脸。	2
411	But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.	3
412	It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.	3
413	How very silly of him not to stay here! said the Rocket.	2
414	他在幻觉中看见自己站立于大教堂高高的祭坛上，身穿华贵的龙袍，他那孩童般的嘴角露出顽皮而持久的微笑,他那黑髏黯林地般的眼睛放射岀明亮的光芒。	0
415	Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family."	0
416	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
