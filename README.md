# ChatMASS
 Implementation of text generation model based on GPT and MASS algorithm. Slightly change the model structure. Focus on Chinese generation.
 The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) algorithm is a type of neural network architecture used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language generation, language translation, and language understanding.

## On Implementation
1. Will provide the Chinese pre-trained model in future.
2. Researching on emotion-based dyeing diffusion algorithm.
